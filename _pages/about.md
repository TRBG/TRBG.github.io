Currently I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California - San Diego. A member of the [Video Processing Lab](http://videoprocessing.ucsd.edu/), I am supervised by [Prof. Truong Nguyen](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=48). A Lecturer in the Electrical Engineering Department at [KFUPM](www.kfupm.edu.sa) on academic leave to pursue my PhD. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 2010 and my MSc in Electrical Enginerring from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, California, in 2013. My research interests focus on solving problems in signal and image processing with applications to medical and seismic imaging. Recently these problems are being approached through a machine and deep learning lense.
